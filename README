A Graphical User Interface for Examining R Profile Output
=========================================================

This package provides a GUI for the proftools package. The main widget 
features include call trees, function summaries and source annotations.
The widget is interactive, giving the user the capability to alter viewing 
options and use plotting tools from within the widget.

Note: This package requires the proftools and gWidgets2 packages. It also 
requires one of gWidgets2RGtk2 or gWidgets2tcltk packages to be used as the 
underlying toolkit, with gWidgets2RGtk2 being preferred.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

The package exports one function:

    startWidget launches a GUI widget with interactive profiling tools for 
        Rprof output, .R files, and R code.
        
A SIMPLE EXAMPLE

Read in the profile data for the example in the proftools package

        pd <- readProfileData(system.file("samples", "Rprof-rec.out",
                                          package="proftools"))
        startWidget(pd)

Alternatively, just launch the widget and use the file menu to browse 
and select the stack file

        startWidget(NULL)
