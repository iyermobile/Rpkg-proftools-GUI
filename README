A Graphical User Interface for Examining R Profile Output
=========================================================


This package provides a GUI for the proftools package. The main widget 
features include call trees, function summaries and source annotations.
The widget is interactive, giving the user the capability to alter viewing 
options and use plotting tools from within the widget.

Note: This package requires the proftools and gWidgets2 packages. It also 
requires one of gWidgets2RGtk2 or gWidgets2tcltk packages to be used as the 
underlying toolkit, with gWidgets2RGtk2 being preferred.


EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

The package exports one function:

    startWidget launches a GUI widget with interactive profiling tools for 
        Rprof output, .R files, and R code.
        
        
A SIMPLE EXAMPLE

Read in the profile data for the example in the proftools package

        pd <- readProfileData(system.file("samples", "Rprof-rec.out",
                                          package="proftools"))
        startWidget(pd)

Alternatively, just launch the widget and use the file menu to browse 
and select the stack file. You can alter viewing options from witing the 
widget rather than specifying the arguments when calling the function.

        startWidget(NULL)
        
Note that source annotations are not shown. This is because the source 
filenames given in Rprof-rec.out cannot be found in the working directory. 
We can fix this by temporarily changing the working directory to the samples 
directory in the proftools package.

        oldDir <- getwd()
        setwd(system.file("samples", package="proftools"))
        pd <- readProfileData(system.file("samples", "Rprof-lmfit.out", 
                                          package="proftools"))
        startWidget(pd)
        setwd(oldDir)
